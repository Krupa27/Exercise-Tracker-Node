# Exercise-Tracker-Node

Using Nodejs, Expressjs, and MongoDB Atlas, I created an Exercise tracker which consists of a basic database authentication to display the user logs as well in JSON format.
I used Cyclic to deploy the project on the world-wide-web.

The above project is Active at https://krupa-exercise-tracker.cyclic.app/  üëç
